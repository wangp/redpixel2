@Fixed a major memory leak.  Also, fixed the semantics of store_unload
(entries in the `store' array which pointed to items in the datafile
being unloaded get cleared to NULL; all other items keep their
indices).

@History

1 February 2002: Fixed a major memory leak.  Also, fixed the semantics
of store_unload.

19 January 2002: The Allegro unicode string functions are about 3
times slower than libc string functions (by my tests), so I decided to
revert to the libc functions and only support ASCII/UTF-8.

02 July 2001: Updated for new Allegro Unicode API (although it's still not
properly Unicode-enabled).

1 June 2001: Use AL_CONST instead of const.

28 April 2001: Some changes in the hash table implementation.

June 2000: Initial version, for Red Pixel II.
