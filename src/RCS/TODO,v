@split objects into different areas?
	probably good because soon particles will need collision
	detection against objects

map_link_object and map_link_object_bottom may be reversed
	(or the renderers are)

spawning lots of projectiles makes server become really
	slow, probably the do_physics function

reread and recleanup network/physics code
	(I think it's fixed now)

save lua state at the start of the program (after init
	scripts), then use copies of that (for hygiene)

it seems I have been using the _t convention wrongly.
	AFAICS, the _t suffix is used for types which you
	can statically allocate (i.e. you know the size of
	it; usually synonyms for int, long, etc.) All the
	current structures which have _t suffix should
	probably be "struct foobar".


------------------------------

split loaddata?

rename ed_select?

move ed_select to new src/editor/custom dir?
     (custom ug widgets would go in there)

dialog dirtiness not precise enough?
	if not, go to per-widget dirtiness
