split objects into different areas?

map_link_object and map_link_object_bottom may be reversed (or the renderers are)

spawn_projectile too slow?

reread and recleanup network/physics code (I think it's fixed now)

save lua state at the start of the program (after init scripts), then
use copies of that (for hygiene)


------------------------------

split loaddata?

rename ed_select?

move ed_select to new src/editor/custom dir?
     (custom ug widgets would go in there)

dialog dirtiness not precise enough?  if not, go to per-widget dirtiness
