eliminate "stutter" effect
better console


---- code that needs scrapping or rethinking ----

hub.c is written in a very messy way, and has code duplication.  In
particular, the game starting code and synchronising the start between
the server and clients is very bad

cannot join halfway through a game

no "stop game, but enter lobby" yet

gameloop.c has lots of testing stuff in there

gamenet.c is not great 

gameinit.c may require renaming

split loaddata? 

vars.c is silly

the modes in editor/ may be able to share code
