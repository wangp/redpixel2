physics.c merged with object.c

split objects into different areas?

clean up: client/server in the same process

map_link_object and map_link_object_bottom may be reversed (or the renderers are)

------------------------------

split loaddata?

rename ed_select?

move ed_select to new src/editor/custom dir?
     (custom ug widgets would go in there)

dialog dirtiness not precise enough?  if not, go to per-widget dirtiness
