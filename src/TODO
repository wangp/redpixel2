maybe delete pthread/win32 code in favour of Pth-only

when using Pth the music thread can cause a jerk while loading the next song

code consistency, (e.g. between map, object, particles, explosions, render)
	the code has a stop-start-stop-start feel to it (but at least
		it works :-)

too many packets sent, e.g. for jumping

server will think send error if our game state is plainly too big to
	fit into libnet's conn outqueue

spawning lots of projectiles makes server become really
	slow, probably the do_physics function


------------------------------

split loaddata?

rename ed_select?

move ed_select to new src/editor/custom dir?
     (custom ug widgets would go in there)

dialog dirtiness not precise enough?
	if not, go to per-widget dirtiness
