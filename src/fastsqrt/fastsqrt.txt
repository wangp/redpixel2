I took these files from the Red Pixel 1 source, which took it from Brennan
Underwood's now-defunct site.  I stripped the asm versions of fastsqrt as
they don't work right under Linux, I don't know how to fix it, and they're
not really necessary.  

The original readme follows.

Umm.... just a few things I use in my game.

fastflot.h: contains an inline fast float to int rounder. Do not pass in
            anything greater or equal to 2^23.
fastsqrt.c
and
fastsqrt.h: put them together, you get a roughly 3x faster than fsqrt sqrt()
            In general, you'll want to call fast_fsqrt_asm(), but the
            original Graphics Gems fast_fsqrt() is still in there in C
            for reference.
            Call build_sqrt_table() first!
            The drawback to this routine is that you can be up to, I think 6%
            off in your answer. But in a supa-fast 3d engine where no one
            would notice the diff anyway, there you go.

If you're not getting this directly from my site, they originally came
from
http://brennan.home.ml.org/djgpp/
or
http://brennan.home.ml.org/programming/

My main page is

quite a feast for the senses, I hope.
