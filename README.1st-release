Not much you can do.  You can try to compile it, with

	make dos
	
or if you're using X, 
	
	make X
	
You will need these libraries: Allegro / XWinAllegro, SeeR.  Much more to be
added.	
	
Inside the map editor you can scroll around with W A S D.  If you move the
pointer to the right side of the screen (where the tiles are), you can
scroll this with W S.  

Left click to place a tile.  Right click to erase.  Hold down Shift, then
drag with either button to "block edit".
