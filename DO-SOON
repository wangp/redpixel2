* easy

** code
gamma
esc shouldn't quit
some messages don't refresh the lobby screen
lights for sparks?
screen shakes for explosions
recoil from getting blasted [make amount damage dependent]
meat chunks from explosive death
barrel chunks inertia
blods inertia?
server should log kills messages
make lightamp respawn time longer

** non-code
vulcan [graphics/sound]
blood lust visuals
food consume sound
flame for torch
health icons

* harder

** more interesting/necessary
better gui
what-weapons-collected display
radar/scanner
map scrolly thingi
lua gc jerking
corpses, backpacks on crates (not hard, but want to do it elegantly, not a hack)

** less interesting
corpses continue moving in direction of player
music
doc-generation from bindgen.lua
blast circles should provide a bit of light (dunno how)

* maps
bell tower map
rocket arena explosives
