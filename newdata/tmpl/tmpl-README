Red Pixel 2 addon: Template version X.Y.Z

This directory demonstrates how we think addons should be organised.  We
recommend that you follow it to keep things simple, but you don't have to
if you don't want to, or if it doesn't fit your addon.

All data files in addon `tmpl' should have the prefix "tmpl-", therefore:

    tmpl-bkgd/		-- directory containing backgrounds
    tmpl-tile.dat	-- tile graphics
    tmpl-weapon.dat	-- weapon graphics
    tmpl-powerup.dat	-- powerup graphics
	...

The initialisation file would then be called `tmpl-init.lua'.  The
initialisation file needs to load datafiles, and register new object
types, etc.  Again, we recommend you use the addon's name as a prefix
for everything.  For example:

    store_load ("tmpl/tmpl-weapon.dat", "/tmpl/weapon")
    objtype_register ("item", "tmpl-zapper",
    		      "/tmpl/weapon/zapper/pickup", tmpl_zapper_init)
	...

Each module should also have a README file like this one, containing:

    - name and version of the addon
    - required addons, if any
    - a short description
    - installation instructions
    - authors' name, web site, email addresses, etc.
