This directory contains some code that might be useful.

bin2c.c
	This program converts files to byte arrays that are automatically
	run with lua_dobuffer. This allows C programs to include all necessary
	Lua code, even in precompiled form. Even if the code is included in
	source form, bin2c is useful because it avoids the hassle of having to
	quote special characters in C strings.
	Example of usage: Run bin2c file1 file2 ... > init.h. Then, in your C
	program, just do #include "init.h" anywhere in the *body* of a
	function. This will be equivalent to calling
		lua_dofile(L,"file1"); lua_dofile(L,"file2"); ...
	Note that the Lua state is called "L". If you use a different name,
	say "mystate", just #define L mystate before #include "init.h".

def.lua
	A Lua script for creating .DEF files for Windows DLLs.
	Just do "make def" to create lua.def.
	Try also "lua make_def.lua" which creates lualib.def.

lua.ico
	A Lua icon for Windows.
	It was drawn by hand by Markus Gritsch <gritsch@iue.tuwien.ac.at>.

lua.magic
	Data for teaching file(1) about Lua precompiled chunks.

lua.xpm
	The same icon as lua.ico, but in XPM format.
	It was converted with ImageMagick by Andy Tai <andy@exp.com>.

lua3.c, lua3.h
	An emulation of Lua 3.2 API on top of Lua 4.0 API.
	To use it, just include lua3.h instead of lua.h.
	Do not include lualib.h or lauxlib.h because lua3.h includes
	a version of both. If you need to use both 3.2 and 4.0 APIs,
	include lua.h before lua3.h.

min.c
	A minimal Lua interpreter.

setfallback.lua
	A Lua implementation of fallbacks on top of tag methods.
	You only need this module if you have Lua code that uses setfallback.

stdcall.lua
	A Lua script for changing the calling convention to __stdcall.
	Do "make stdcall" and new modules will be created in stdcall/.

trace.c
	A simple execution tracer.
	An example of how to use the debug hooks in C.
