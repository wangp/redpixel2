Notes on using bmark.c
----------------------

1)

For more accurate results, I suggest you comment out

    #define DRAWSTUFF

at the top of the file.  However, you will miss out on the sprites (oh..)


2)

bmark.c gives you a reading every 4 or so seconds.  Please ignore the first 
reading, this is REALLY inaccurate.  The next couple of readings will be 
more consistant results.

3)

I'm not exactly sure about the accuracy of this, so.. just use it to compare 
PPCol's functions.


Ok, that's about it
