Red Pixel II Engine Design: Details
-----------------------------------

The Engine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Thing **

	Every *engine* entity in RP2 is a ``Thing''.  The structure is something
	like:
	
		Thing {
			var name;
			var x, y;
			var pic;
			var stats;
			var input;	/* piping */
			var output;
			var glow;
			var transp;	/* 0 = opaque */
		}
		
	The piping is to allow something like the piping in Unix.  Practical
	example: An Alien is shot and killed, sending off a ``blip'' to a
	Bridge, which tells ten more Aliens to awaken and kill the player.


** InvisibleThing **

	Things which are invisible are, not surprisingly, called
	InvisibleThings.  These things cannot be ``touched'' (or shot, etc.)
	
	
** VisibleThing **

	The solid stuff, including Creatures, Walls, Pickups, etc.
	
	
** Gate **

	Gates should allow some interesting maps in RP2.  For example, the AND
	gate might have two input attachments A and B, and one output, R.
	
		     ____   
		A --|    \
		    | and | -- R
		B --|____/
	
	R would receive a blip only when A and B both report TRUE.
	
	``Special'' gates:
	
	** Pulse gate **
	
		Every X seconds the gate send a blip.  Good for flashing
		EnvLights.
		
	** Delay **
	
		Recieves a blip, but does not send it until X number of seconds.
		
		
** Trigger **

	I don't like this being separate from Gates.  They are about the same,
	but somehow different.
	
	** Area trigger **
	
		When a Human enters the area (x1,y1) - (x2,y2) it generates
		event onEnter().  Likewise for onExit().
		
	** Timer **
	
		Generates onTimer() every X seconds.
		
** Snippet **

	A scrap of JavaScript code, floating in mid-air.  Triggers and Gates can
	connect to this to execute the script whenever a blip is sent.
	
	
** EnvLight **

	Environmental light.  For mood setting.  Size, brightness and colour
	adjustable.
	
	
** Wall **

	This needs no explaination, except that there are two categories.
	
	
** Door **

	Perhaps this should be in with Wall.  Opens and closes according to
	blips.
	
	
** Pickup **

	Yep.
	
	
** Missle **

	The stuff that the guns fire.  Things that can hurt Creatures.  Note
	that Mine is also in the category, even though it doesn't move like a
	bullet.  

	
** Creature **

	The organic Things in the game that generate blood.  Enemies, a.k.a.
	Aliens in single player mode are included in this category.  These are

	
The Additional Stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not Things, but still important.

** Glow **

	Every Thing can have a Glow attached to it.  A Glow is a light source,
	with brightness, size, colour.
	

** Explosion **

** Particle **
	
	** Spark **


Stats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** WeaponStats **

** MissleStats **

** ExploSeq **

	Explosion sequence, containing frame names and tic times.
