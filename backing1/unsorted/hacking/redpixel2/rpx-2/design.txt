(revised) code design a.k.a. code split
----------------------------------------

- map editor written in JavaScript
    (support functions written in C)

- engine written in C
    (drawing, lighting, input, etc.)
    
- networking written in C        

- weapon/object handling in JS
    (eg. firing, picking up, etc.)
    
- AI written in JS

- object structures handled in C
    (with linked lists)
    
    Static lists may have JS duplicates
    for speed reasons.
