<title>WUMPUS, the smelly Allegro extension.
<author>Peter Wang, <tt/tjaden@psynet.net/
<abstract>
This document is a brief manual for the Allegro datafile 
extension (addon), Wumpus.
</abstract>

<toc>



<sect>Introduction
<p>
    Wumpus is an abstraction layer for Allegro DATAFILEs that allows
    you to access the items via their names, rather than their index
    numbers.  While this is not new, and can be easily done without
    using an external library, Wumpus uses hash tables to quickly
    find the item you want.

    You can also load many separate datafiles together and use them
    as a single unit (see <ref id="sec-gellopii" name="gellopii">).

    The API is designed to be consistent with Allegro.

	
	
<sect>Compiling
<p>
    Edit the makefile accordingly, then run `make'.

    It should work.



<sect>Wumpii<label id="sec-wumpii">
<p>
    Wumpii are datafiles with hash tables to the items attached.

<descrip>
<tag>WUMPUS *load_wumpus(char *filename);</tag>
	Load a datafile (.dat) file into memory, returning a pointer
	to a WUMPUS structure if successful, or NULL on error.
	Automatically hashes the items in the file.

<tag>void unload_wumpus(WUMPUS *w);</tag>
	Frees the wumpus from memory.

<tag>void rebuild_wumpus_hash(WUMPUS *w);</tag>
        If you manually hack at the datafile structure in your code,
	then run this function on the wumpus to rebuild the internal
	hash table.

<tag>DATAFILE *wumpus_datafile(WUMPUS *w, char *key)</tag>
	Retrieve item KEY from wumpus.
	
<tag>void *wumpus_dat(WUMPUS *w, char *key)</tag>
	Retrieve the .dat field, rather than the DATAFILE * itself.

<tag>char *get_wumpus_property(WUMPUS *w, char *key, int type)</tag>
        Get the datafile property of TYPE from item KEY.
	
<tag>char *get_wumpus_tag(WUMPUS *w, char *key, char *type)</tag>
	Same, but allows you to pass a 4 byte string for the type,
	rather than a DAT_ID.
</descrip>



<sect>Gellopii<label id="sec-gellopii">
<p>
    The `fat_gellopy' is a big internal hash table of all the
    datafiles that have been linked into it.  Note that if you are
    using gellopii you do not need to use wumpii.

    If two wumpuses have name space collisions, then the one linked
    in second will override the original.  This way you can set up
    PWAD (patch WAD) systems ala DOOM.

<descrip>
<tag>int install_gellopy(int size);</tag>
	Call this at the start of your program to set the size of the
	fat_gellopy hash table.  A larger hash table requires more
	memory, but reduces the chance of a collision in your table
	(which will slow down retrieval times).

<tag>void remove_gellopy();</tag>
	You should not normally need to call this manually, as
	install_gellopy will set up an atexit call to it.

<tag>void link_datafile(DATAFILE *d, char *basename);</tag>

<tag>void unlink_datafile(DATAFILE *d);</tag>

<tag>void link_wumpus(WUMPUS *w, char *basename);</tag>

<tag>void unlink_wumpus(WUMPUS *w);</tag>

 	Link and unlink DATAFILEs and WUMPUSes into the fat gellopy.
	When you unlink a file, wumpus will automatically rebuild
	the entire fat gellopy hash table.

<tag>DATAFILE *gellopy_datafile(char *key)</tag>

<tag>void *gellopy_dat(char *key)</tag>

<tag>char *get_gellopy_property(char *key, int type)</tag>

<tag>char *get_gellopy_tag(char *key, char *type)</tag>
	
	See section <ref id="sec-wumpii" name="WUMPII">.

<sect>Hash table functions
<p>
    See hash.c if you want to use them.
	


<sect>Alternative spellings...
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
&num;define HASHED_DATAFILE		WUMPUS
&num;define load_hashed_datafile	load_wumpus
&num;define unload_hashed_datafile	unload_wumpus
&num;define rebuild_hash_table	rebuild_wumpus_hash
&num;define install_hashed_datafile	install_gellopy
&num;define remove_hashed_datafile	remove_gellopy
&num;define link_hashed_datafile	link_wumpus
&num;define unlink_hashed_datafile	unlink_wumpus
</verb></tscreen>
    The use of these `alternative spellings' is discouraged.
	
	
<sect>Example usage
<p>
    See example.c.  

    (Need more examples?  That's about as complicated as it gets.)
    


<sect>Credits
<p>
    Peter Wang mashed this together.

    Jerry Coffin and HenkJan Wolthuis wrote the hash table code,
    which was put in the Snippets collection (public domain).

    BTW, can someone confirm the spelling of `gellopy'?



<sect>History
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>29/06/1999</tag>

	Thought of idea to create a new WAD-style file format for Red
	Pixel II, based off ideas from `mie'.  Designed structure of
	file and began creating structures in code. As it turns out,
	the file format did not really offer anything that Allegro
	datafiles did not provide (except a better grabbing utility)
	so the code was scrapped, and this was written.

<tag>30/06/1999</tag>

	Got idea to do a global hash table for all datafiles, so the
	gellopy stuff was written. 
	
<tag>01/07/1999</tag>
    
        Editted header a bit to make it work with Allegro 3.9.20.
	
	
<tag>05/09/1999</tag>
    
        Editted header (extern "C") for C++ programs -- untested.
	
	
<tag>25/09/1999</tag>
      
        Fixed example.c to work with Allegro 3.9.25.
	Changed Makefile (removed platform.XXX).
	Fixed bugs in unlink_datafile and unlink_wumpus.


<tag>10/10/1999</tag>

	Converted README to SGML, Just For Fun!
