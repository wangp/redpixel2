	Bloody SeeR is hard to debug!
	
25	autoexp!
	Fixed bug in tile mode.

28	More stuff to get scripting really going (problem encountered because

May 1999
--------

1	Simple object placement working.

11	Separated palette from dbuf (now dbuf / palbuf).

14	Simple load/save routines (incomplete).
	Object removing.
	Changed convtabl so it uses realloc, instead of a set size at the
	start of the program.
	Simple tiledat loading (not using tiletbl, yet)

20	Fixed load routine - now using convtables (tiletbl)!
	Started test tile engine. [don't work right yet]
	
21	Installed Red Hat 6.0!

22      Did something?  Maybe.

23	Rearranged a few things then accommodated that to support
	PPCOL_MASKS.  Yum.
	Continued with dodgey engine test - demo to show at school tomorrow.
	I hate deadlines.
	Some half-working player/tile collision routines.
	Corpses showing on the screen.	

26 	Didn't I do anything yesterday? ...
	Stuck in legs, but now SeeR won't compile scripts/rpg.sc
	SeeR is a bit iffy.
	Now it works again... 

29	Investigating other scripting languages, as SeeR is shitting me.
	(Lua in particular)

30	Trying to "export" Allegro functions to Lua scripts.

31	Tried again (from scratch).  It works! (but with a few glitches)


June 1999
---------
6	Back on the job, after playing with Descent (I & II) and NEW ORBITAL
	CD!!  Development should be a lot faster :)
	Map editor mode registering works, and the Lua functions are getting
	called properly.
	Rearranged how the map editor works (a little)
	Tile drawing in map editor works again.

11	Created a crappy luamode.sl for jed.
	Moving some more stuff out of mapedit.c, so that even 'halcyon' is
	in a script.
        Lua rocks!

12      ??

27	Holidays!  Back to work.
