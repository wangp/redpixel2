This directory contains a stripped down copy of PDCurses 2.4.  The one
change has been to rename `clear' to `curs_clear', as it conflicts with
`clear' from Allegro.  The demos, docs, panel lib, files for non-Win32
systems have been removed.

There is a precompiled static library, built for Mingw32.  I stripped the
distribution *after* making the build, so it might not build again without
some help.
