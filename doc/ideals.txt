Ideals, or Milestones (if I was aiming for them)
------------------------------------------------

* Ideal 1: Roughly the same playability as Red Pixel 1.
  - single multiplayer mode (deathmatch) over a LAN
  - the basic weapons
  - maybe demo mode

* Ideal 2: Enhanced multiplayer mode.
  - highly scriptable levels
  - many game modes
  - bots
  - internet support

* Ideal 3: Single player missions.
  - requires a lot of art and level design
  - even more scriptable levels
  - "intelligent" enemies
  - storyline
  - music


Ideal 1 is fairly close.

Ideal 2 probably won't be reached.  Not enough people would play to
offset the work.

Ideal 3 requires an artist to go it alone.  Not going to happen.
