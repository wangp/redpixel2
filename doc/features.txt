* Game

** [DONE] looking feel (mouse pushes view)

** gates
Gates are connected to objects and follow real electronics,
e.g. flip-flops act on change of state, etc.  Gates are really just
invisible objects.
- normal logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XNOR
- multiplexer: pings each object in turn when receiving ping
- delay: passes on a ping after a set time
- clock: sends a ping every n usecs; turned on/off with a ping
- executor: runs a script when pinged; may be attached to objects to
  run scripts on the objects

** triggers
Triggers call functions upon some event.  They may be wired up to
objects or gates if necessary (e.g. open a door, etc.)
- area triggers: execute same/different functions if an object
  enters/exits the area; 
- push against trigger: triggered when an object pushes against it

** grouping mulitiple things as one object (e.g. blown up at same time)
- probably can be implemented with gates and triggers only

** base defence turrets

** radar thing
sweeps around in a circle like a real radar, and points out players in
those directions (temporarily, like a real radar)

** tracker
Points in direction of closest enemy.  In multiplayer, another tracker
always point in the direction of closest ally (this tracker is given,
you don't have to pick it up).  The needle reaches its destination
slowly, like a compass (and "bounces" too).

** beacon
maybe something to show where a base is.  It has about six small lights
which originate from its centre, and move outwards.  Then they go back to
the centre and loop.

** set-able gravity for different maps

** gravity pulls down bullets slightly

** [?] mouse locking onto map

** [?] grappling hook/ninja rope

** [?] accuracies vary depending on gun / weapon weight

** [?] accuracies vary depending on arms used to hold it

** [?] scout / helicopter (like tribes)

** [?] slowly bleed to death when on _very_ low health

** [?] AI scripts

* Eye candy

** [DONE] blood-trails when low health (around 50%), spew more when almost dead

** [DONE] environmental lights

** [DONE] explosion circles like in `rtl'

** [DONE] torch light

** [DONE] respawning-ball glows and shoots out sparks

** smoke puffs
.. I forgot what these were meant to be

** small flash when a player w/ shields is shot (like in StarCraft)

** [DONE] barrels spawn chunks & particles when exploded

** particles
- different sized particles (not just single pixels) translucency and
- lighting [?] scripts control particles (movement and look) [?]
- sprite particles (i.e. particles which are actually BITMAPs)

** [?] monkey bars
Really tough physics-wise, not sure if very useful either.  Non-square
tiles was hard enough...

** [?] players glow like in `pandemonium'

** [?] glows used to separate teams (red, green, blue, purple)

** [DONE] light-amp tints the screen (0x182b65 at 50%)

** [NO] bloodlusted-bullets glows red
can't tell

** [NO] player hit by a bloodlusted-bullet glow red
players already glow red

** [?] lights have settable strength

** [DONE] smoke behind rockets

** [?] water
- with swimming
- floating bloods
- turns red tint on lots of blood in water (might be too hard)
- can be implemented with area triggers (lower object's mass or
  gravity while in area) and a transparent secondary object layer

** [?] rain
- can be done with particles or secondary object layer

** [?] snow
- can be done with particles
- player can "kick" them up when running over?
- might be slippery like ice

** [?] ice tiles (slippery to walk on)
- can be done with an area trigger on top (lower walking friction upon
  entering the area
- or maybe a push-against trigger

** [?] secondary object layer
- on top of main object layer, but under the light layer
- might give more depth to game?  might be distracting or slow
- for example, water objtiles on the secondary layer (above the
  primary object layer) can be translucent to give the water look; 
  can also animate them for the wavy effect

** [?] Lua scripted looks of the screen layout

* Tiles

** grates are not blow-up-able, objects can stand on them

** grates can have diffent size holes, letting different sized bullets through

** force-field thingy allows slow things through (like in Dune)
idea from James Lewis?

** portals

** [?] springs

** [?] slippery tiles

** [?] pushable objects

* Weapons

** [NO] guns can have frames that don't rotate (eg. 1 arm shotty)
not necessary at this stage

** [NO] guns can choose a random frame when shooting (eg. uzi, minigun)
not worth it, can't see in battle

** [NO] recoil

* Other

** frags per minute

** [HOLD] handicaps
damage multipliers.  e.g. newbie vs. veteran does 125% damage; veteran
vs. newbie does 75% damage
{Will not have enough players to warrant}

** [HOLD] spectators
{Will not have enough players to warrant}

** demos

** death viewer

** proper chat screen (maybe in-game)

** [NO] pass server
{This is impossible given scripting}

** [NO] swap to another server executable
good during development
{This is impossible given scripting}

** [?] person with `flag' has a cow head sticking out of backpack

** [ART/HOLD] single player mode
Requires much artwork.  Encourage some artist to do it once
multiplayer version properly released.

** [?] up to 8 players in deathmatches
already works?

** [NO] microphone chat
Not worth the effort.

** [?] rp1 and rp2 differences

** [ART] intro movie
Ask if some artist is willing to do it.

** [DONE] name of player above/below their icon
** [?] colours shows the team of player

** [NO] arrow points at person w/ flag (colour depends on flags owner)
