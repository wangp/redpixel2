	* basic-player.lua: Put in playing walking animation.

	* basic-player.lua:
	Fixed a problem with the test corpse where the corpse object would be
	replicated to new clients, but the new client would think the corpse
	was starting at animation frame 0.  The solution was to use the
	creation field feature.

	* basic-weapon.lua: Rotate blaster projectile in the angle it is fired

	* basic-player.lua:
	Update hook changes.  Also the beginnings of corpses

	* basic-base.lua: Update hook and creation fields changes
