Starting & compiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To start using the precompiled binaries, run `program.exe' under
  Windows or `program' under Linux.  You will need an Allegro 4.0.x
  .dll/.so installed.  At the moment you must run the program from the
  directory the binary resides in, otherwise it won't be able to find
  some data files.

  To compile you need gcc (MinGW under Windows) and Allegro.  gcc3 is
  untested.  MinGW users should run `prepare-mingw.bat' before running
  `make'.  Linux users can just run `make'.
